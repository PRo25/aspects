# aspects
Aspect Oriented Programming framework in typescript (WIP).
To know more about the concepts of AOP check here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming.

This library intends to be a starting point to allow you to easily implement new aspects. The approach taken here was to provide a fluent API to define an aspect.
